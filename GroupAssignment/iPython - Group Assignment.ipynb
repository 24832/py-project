    "You have been assigned to a working group, which will contribute to a collaborative project. The collaborative project has 3 working groups contributing to a common goal: \n",
    "- The development of a decision support tool for irrigation needs for 1) early stage plants, 2) established plants\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to irrigate relies on the following 3 premises:\n",
    "- Soil water tension (pF) should be above certain threshold defined by user/farmer (e.g. 3.2 log (-h))\n",
    "- Irrigation decision should account for the rain forescast in the next 24 hours, i.e. if ammount of rain is over a certain threshold (defined by user), no need to irrigate (e.g. 2 mm)\n",
    "- Irrigation, even if needed, should not occur if vapour pressure deficit is below a certain threshold, defined by user (e.g. 0.5 kPa)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group will focus on a part of this tool\n",
    "- Group 1 - Will Retrieve weather data and soil state predictions from online api\n",
    "  - delivers/continue the file group1.py\n",
    "- Group 2 - Calculates soil tension (pF) \n",
    "  - delivers/continue the file group2.py\n",
    "- Group 3 (end point) - Creates the API to interact with enduser \n",
